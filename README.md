# Feels-Good-Man
Final Project for ITP-341 (App Development for Android Phones and Tablets)

Introducing “Feels Good Man”, which is an Android app to quickly relieve the stress of college students to improve their mental state and increase productivity. It will have several features that the user can click on to reduce stress, such as viewing cute puppy. The point is that the app is quick and comfortable, and the user can set a reminder so the app can notify the user to destress at a certain point in the day.


## Motivation and Need
It seems that today’s students are experiencing increasingly more stress than students in previous decades, and it doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. As a college student, I am constantly swamped with juggling several tasks in my life. Between academics, extracurricular activities, social events, I often get very overwhelmed with all the stuff I have to do. There’s a common saying that goes “Pick two. Sleep, social life, and good grades.” Surveys have shown evidence that there has been a 60% increase in stress-induced mental illnesses for college students and suicide rates are significantly higher as well. Students often put mental and physical health at a lower priority, so there needs to be a way that students can reduce their levels of stress in a convenient and pleasing manner.
